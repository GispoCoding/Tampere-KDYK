# Tampere-KDYK
KIRA-digi project on planned land use in collaboration with City of Tampere and Gispo

The documents published here are backround information for creating future general land use plan for City of Tampere. The documentation contains these documents:

-Conceptual model for the future general land use plan of city of Tampere, containing different reference documents, data sources, decitions, code lists and monitoring. The model is in Finnish and it does not contain all possible information. The meaning of the document is to give enough information for the actual database modelling process.

-Core terms used in Finnish land use planning. Since there have not existed one publically available "Yleiskaavoitus" term document  before, this originally for internal use aimed document can be useful more broadly.
